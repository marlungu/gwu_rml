### Grid Search AIR vs. AUC for EBMs

Below, we have a scatter plot of the Adverse Impact Ratio (AIR) against the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) for the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) model. This plot enables us to examine the trade-off between fairness (as measured by AIR) and model performance (as measured by AUC).
The red vertical line drawn at AIR = 0.8 represents a fairness threshold. Any model falling to the right of this line would be fair according to the Four-Fifths Rule, commonly used in employment practices to measure disparate impact.

### Visualize simulated data

Here we have histograms for each feature in the random_frame DataFrame, where each histogram displays the distribution of values for one feature.

##### Cutoffs in the 0.22-0.26 range provide increased accuracy and less bias toward others


### Residual Analysis Plot

> Below, we can see that residuals are very unbalanced. This model struggles to predict when customers will receive a high-priced loan correctly. It does much better when predicting customers will NOT receive a high-priced loan. There are also some very noticeable outliers.

### Plot tree depth vs. training and validation AUC

Decision Tree Classifier for various depths (1 to 20) computes the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) for the training and validation sets.

> Training and validation AUC are relatively close at lower depths (closer to 0 index), indicating the model is neither overfitting nor underfitting. We achieve the maximum AUC for the validation set at a tree depth of 6, with an AUC score of approximately 0.807270. After this point, while the training AUC increases, the validation AUC decreases as the tree depth increases. This is a typical sign of overfitting, as the model is becoming too complex and is starting to fit the noise in the training data.


### Create a DataFrame for visualization & Sort by importance

* This extracts the feature importance scores from the model. Feature importance scores indicate how useful or valuable each feature was in constructing the boosted decision trees within the model. The higher the score, the more important the feature.

<img src="https://github.com/marlungu/gwu_rml/blob/main/assignment_6/data/feut_imp.png">

From the resulting plot, you can observe which features impact the model's predictions most.
