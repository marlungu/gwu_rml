### Quantitative Analysis

* Models were assessed primarily with AUC and AIR. See details below:

| Train AUC | Validation AUC 
| --------- | -------------- 
| 0.970011  | 0.623467

| Group              | Validation AIR |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Black vs. White    |         0.816 |
| Hispanic vs. White |         0.8765 |
| Asian vs. White    |          1.208 |
| Female vs. Male    |          0.948 |

### Grid Search AIR vs. AUC for EBMs

![Grid Search AIR vs. AUC for EBMs](grid.png)

> Below, we have a scatter plot of the Adverse Impact Ratio (AIR) against the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) for the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) model. This plot enables us to examine the trade-off between fairness (as measured by AIR) and model performance (as measured by AUC).
The red vertical line drawn at AIR = 0.8 represents a fairness threshold. Any model falling to the right of this line would be fair according to the Four-Fifths Rule, commonly used in employment practices to measure disparate impact.
### Visualize simulated data

> Here we have histograms for each feature in the random_frame DataFrame, where each histogram displays the distribution of values for one feature.

### Residual Analysis Plot

> Residuals are very unbalanced. This model struggles to predict when customers will recieve a high-priced loan correctly. It does much better when predicting customers will NOT receive a high-priced loan. There are also some very noticable outliers.

### Plot tree depth vs. training and validation AUC

### View results as a table, using pandas iloc to remove first column of table

### Create a DataFrame for visualization & Sort by importance

* This extracts the feature importance scores from the model. Feature importance scores indicate how useful or valuable each feature was in constructing the boosted decision trees within the model. The higher the score, the more important the feature.

From the resulting plot, you can observe which features impact the model's predictions most.
